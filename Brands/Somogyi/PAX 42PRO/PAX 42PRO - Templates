# These are 2 additional filters if you plan on using this model for more than just home listening, like backyard parties.

# This is Peaking filter which is used to quietten down the tweeter. This can be used if you don't want to modify the EQ directly. Why offer this? For user convenience.
Filter: ON PK Fc 20000 Hz Gain 0 dB BW Oct 1.75

# This is High-Shelf filter which is also used to quietten down the tweeter. Similar reasons as above. This may yield less treble detail compared to Peaking Filter but will be less harsh.
