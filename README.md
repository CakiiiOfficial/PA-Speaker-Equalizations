# EQ for PA speakers
Many PA speakers are harsh so I've made this repository in order to make life easier for other PA speaker users and have better sound.

I use Equalizer APO on a Windows machine to make PA speakers more enjoyable to listen to. Files here contain EQ info which you can import and try to see if they sound good and adjust it yourself if you want to. You can use this on other equalizers which can improve sound experience if you use a Mac or a Linux or any type of machine assuming they have EQ feature. Make sure to apply EQ accordingly to not ruin sound in the end.

If you're using a subwoofer along with the speaker you're using EQ for, it's recommended to set all sub-bass frequencies to -2 (not 0 anymore) so they can be reproduced by the sub, otherwise, keep it to protect your top's woofers.

If you happen to be able to improve the EQ or want to have speakers from other brands here, you may go ahead and fork or branch it which can help everyone improve PA speakers in a long run.

I also made an EQ for that may apply for the piezo that you may own yourself in your PA setup. Test around and see if it blends well, otherwise you may need to modify the EQ yourself.

# Why -2dB cut?
I've done some heavy testing around slight cuts across the entire spectrum (1Hz-20Khz) for PA speakers and found that cutting 2dB is unnoticable (unless you compare it to the original of course) which gives your amplifier air to breathe so you are less likely to run into distortion issues. You may go ahead and cut -2dB and ask others (assuming they have listened them speakers) if it's any different. The only difference can be noticed is that you turned up the volume with the -2dB cut.


This EQ database is still ongoing for best practices to protect your PA equipment while making them more flat sounding.
